    "more": "This is an interactive visualization of the semantic network of organized non-religious discourses. The corpus consists of over 7 million sentences extracted from 4 non-religious magazines published in the United States and the United Kingdom between 1881 and 2019. The nodes are hierarchically clustered by primary topic (LDA), modularity class (Louvain method), and eigenvector centrality. Groups of nearby nodes therefore represent words that primarily belong to the same latent thematic cluster (a word may belong to multiple topics, if that is the case a list of secondary topics will appear in the information pane when the word is selected), whereas color (based on modularity) defines communities of densely connected terms. For visualization purposes, only the nodes with a frequency of 100 or higher are included. Connections are instead displayed only if the observed frequency is 400 or higher. The statistics reported in the intormation pane were calculated on the full network. For more details, visit the projectâ€™s page on GitHub.",
